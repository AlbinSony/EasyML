# EasyML

**EasyML** is a powerful no-code platform designed to help users train machine learning models without writing a single line of code. It simplifies the complexities of ML and enables individuals from all backgrounds to leverage the power of machine learning for their projects.

## Features
- **Drag-and-drop interface** for building ML models.
- **AutoML support** to automatically select and tune models.
- Pre-built **data preprocessing tools**.
- **Visualization tools** for better understanding of data and model performance.
- Supports **multiple ML algorithms** (classification, regression, clustering).
- Easy **export of trained models** in popular formats.
- **Cross-platform support** (web-based).
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run **EasyML**, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## How to Use

1. **Upload your dataset**: You can upload CSV or Excel files for model training.
2. **Select preprocessing options**: Choose from normalization, feature encoding, handling missing values, etc.
3. **Choose ML algorithm**: Select from the list of supported machine learning algorithms.
4. **Train the model**: Click on the `Train Model` button, and the platform will automatically train the model based on your selections.
5. **Evaluate results**: View the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE, depending on the model type.
6. **Export model**: Save the trained model for deployment in other environments.

## Supported Algorithms

- **Classification**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Regression**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Lasso Regression
- **Clustering**: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering
- **AutoML**: Automatic selection of models with hyperparameter tuning
